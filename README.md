# EQ-works


I am studying Computer Science at McGill University. I am in my fourth year and will be graduating on December2021. I am proficient in Java and Python and figured 
When answering questions I tried to come up with simplest solutions possible. I used Jupyter notebook and Python's Pandas, Numpy frameworks. This year I took a grad level Data science course at Mcgill, which introduced me to Pandas. The work included collecting and manipulating large amounts of data, therefore I figured I can use this language to work on the problems. I noticed these problems could be done with my knowledge from school work. In my machine learning class we are introduced to kNN and applications with sci-learn. I also learned about DAG's, djkstra algorithms in my Data Structures class. It was a great opportunity to apply school work into real life. 
I am interested in human-computer interaction, hoping to join a new industry that gains me new insights, supports women in tech and allows me to put my programming skills in practice.
