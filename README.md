# EQ-works


I am studying Computer Science at McGill University. I am in my fourth year and will be graduating on December2021. I am proficient in Java and Python. When answering questions I tried to come up with simplest solutions possible. I used Jupyter notebook and Python's Pandas, Numpy frameworks. This year I took a grad level Data science course at Mcgill, which introduced me to Pandas. The work included collecting and manipulating large amounts of data, therefore I figured I can use this language to work on the problems. I noticed these problems could be done with my knowledge from school work. In my machine learning class we are introduced to kNN and applications with sci-learn. I also learned about DAG's, djkstra algorithms in my Data Structures class. It was a great opportunity to apply school work into real life. 


Three areas that interest me are Computer Science, Psychology and Finance. Each area can be applied to each other through cognitive science, artificial intelligence and Data analytics. I'm pursuing a minor in psychology to interpret human cognition. The reason I am pursuing this minor is when I drive business, I want to be good at building long lasting relationships with people from different backgrounds. I even want to be approachable to the people who lie to me, make excuses, ignore my effort and be quick enough to understand that there is always a driving reason behind these behaviors. Last year, during pandemic, it was inevitable to disregard the contribution of computers to our lives. With self-driving cars, zoom calls, robot vacuum cleaners technology has made the impossible come true. This inspired me to take part in what can be further accomplished through Computer Science. My dream is one day to be an expert in my field and apply a new technology that touches someones life. 


In completing this problem set, I had a chance to introduce myself to the methods the company uses to drive its business. Problems were familiar to me with what I have practiced at school. I am hoping to join a new industry that gives me new insights, supports women in tech and allows me to put my programming skills in practice.
After completing this internship I plan to specialize in Data Analytics, hoping to take greater responsibility through a senior leadership role to lead a global firm. From my background I believe I have the assests to contribute.
